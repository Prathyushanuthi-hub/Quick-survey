  - Text input questions for open-ended feedback
- **Navigation Controls**: Previous/Next buttons with state management
- **Results Summary**: Display of completed survey responses
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with adaptive layouts

### Technical Features
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No external dependencies for core functionality
